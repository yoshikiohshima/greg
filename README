greg is a re-entrant peg/leg, with some bug fixes.
<http://piumarta.com/software/peg/>

the most comprehensive example of greg usage is in
nagaqueen, an ooc grammar, used in rock, an ooc
compiler written in ooc.

This fork of greg supports the memoization of
failed rule application attempts.  For a language
with more elaborated syntax and operators, a PEG
parser can spend exponentially long time to try
the same rule application at the same input
location.  The typical solution for this problem
is to assume that a grammar rule always returns
the same result (or fail) at the same location and
remember the value (or failure), effectively in
the 2D table of (location, rule_id) -> value.

An interesting feature that Ian's leg has is that it
defers the semantic action execution until the
system "commits" a successfull parse.  (That is
why putting printf() in a failed choice in a rule
does not show any debug log, BTW.)  Because of
this, we cannot remember the successful result; as
it is calculated later while attempting a lot of
reduandant failures.  So, instead, this fork only
remembers the fact that the rule failed; next time
it trys the same rule at the location, it
short-cuts the work and fails.
